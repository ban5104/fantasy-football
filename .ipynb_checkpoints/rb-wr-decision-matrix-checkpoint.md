# RB vs WR Decision Matrix - 14-Team Standard Scoring

## League Context Analysis
- **14 teams, Standard scoring (no PPR)**
- **4pt passing TDs**
- **Starting lineup:** 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 FLEX
- **Key insight:** 3 RBs can start (2 RB + FLEX)
- **No playoffs:** Consistency over ceiling matters

## Positional Scarcity Breakdown

### Total Starting Spots Per Week
- **RB spots:** 42 (14 RB1 + 14 RB2 + 14 FLEX eligible)
- **WR spots:** 42 (14 WR1 + 14 WR2 + 14 FLEX eligible)

### Talent Drop-off Analysis
**RB Talent Cliff:** Sharp drop after ~RB24
- RB1-12: Elite/High-end RB1s
- RB13-24: Solid RB2s with upside
- RB25-36: Inconsistent RB2s/Low-end starters
- RB37+: Handcuffs/dart throws

**WR Talent Slope:** More gradual decline
- WR1-12: Elite WR1s
- WR13-24: Solid WR1/WR2 range
- WR25-36: Reliable WR2/3 options
- WR37-48: Still viable WR3/FLEX plays

## Decision Matrix: RB vs WR Comparisons

### 1. RB20 vs WR10 
**Recommendation: TAKE WR10** ✅

**Analysis:**
- **RB20:** Border of reliable RB2 territory, but inconsistent weekly usage
- **WR10:** Clear WR1 with high target share and red zone looks
- **Value Gap:** WR10 provides significantly more weekly upside
- **Opportunity Cost:** Can find similar RB production 1-2 rounds later

**Expected Points (Standard):**
- RB20: ~12-15 PPG with 8-18 point range
- WR10: ~14-17 PPG with 10-24 point range

---

### 2. RB25 vs WR15
**Recommendation: TAKE RB25** ✅

**Analysis:**
- **RB25:** Last tier of consistent RB2 options
- **WR15:** Solid WR2, but WR depth exists later
- **Scarcity Factor:** RB production becomes unpredictable after this tier
- **Strategic Value:** Locks in 3rd startable RB for your fortress

**Expected Points (Standard):**
- RB25: ~10-13 PPG with inconsistent touches
- WR15: ~11-14 PPG with steady target share

**Key Factor:** This is often the last chance to secure a true RB2

---

### 3. RB30 vs WR20
**Recommendation: TAKE WR20** ✅

**Analysis:**
- **RB30:** Deep into inconsistent territory, likely TD-dependent
- **WR20:** Reliable WR2/3 with consistent target share
- **Floor/Ceiling:** WR20 has much higher floor in standard scoring
- **Roster Construction:** Better to have WR depth than unreliable RB4

**Expected Points (Standard):**
- RB30: ~8-11 PPG with high volatility
- WR20: ~10-13 PPG with steady production

**Key Factor:** RB30 rarely provides startable consistency

---

### 4. RB35 vs WR25
**Recommendation: TAKE WR25** ✅

**Analysis:**
- **RB35:** Handcuff territory or committee back
- **WR25:** Still offers WR2/3 upside with target share
- **Usage Patterns:** RB35 likely touch-limited vs WR25 target certainty
- **Flexibility:** WR25 can still win you weeks

**Expected Points (Standard):**
- RB35: ~6-9 PPG, very game script dependent
- WR25: ~9-12 PPG with more consistent opportunities

---

### 5. RB40 vs WR30
**Recommendation: TAKE WR30** ✅

**Analysis:**
- **RB40:** Deep handcuff or injury-away player
- **WR30:** Potential WR3/FLEX with bye week value
- **Immediate Impact:** WR30 more likely to contribute early
- **Upside:** Both low, but WR has more target opportunity

**Expected Points (Standard):**
- RB40: ~4-7 PPG, highly situational
- WR30: ~7-10 PPG with target floor

---

## Strategic Decision Framework

### Take the RB When:
1. **You need a 3rd startable RB** (RB2 range)
2. **It's the last tier of consistent RB production** (typically RB20-28)
3. **The RB has goal-line role** (standard scoring values TDs highly)
4. **You already have 2 solid WRs**

### Take the WR When:
1. **You already have 3 startable RBs**
2. **The WR is 1+ tiers higher** in positional ranking
3. **You need WR depth** (less available on waivers in 14-team)
4. **The RB is in committee/handcuff territory**

## Tier Break Points (Critical Draft Ranges)

### RB Tier Breaks:
- **Tier 1:** RB1-8 (Elite RB1s)
- **Tier 2:** RB9-16 (High-end RB2s) 
- **Tier 3:** RB17-24 (Solid RB2s) ⚠️ **CRITICAL RANGE**
- **Tier 4:** RB25-32 (Inconsistent RB2s)
- **Tier 5:** RB33+ (Handcuffs/Dart throws)

### WR Tier Breaks:
- **Tier 1:** WR1-6 (Elite WR1s)
- **Tier 2:** WR7-15 (Solid WR1s)
- **Tier 3:** WR16-24 (WR2 range)
- **Tier 4:** WR25-36 (WR3/FLEX range)
- **Tier 5:** WR37+ (Depth/Bye week fills)

## Quick Reference Rules

### Early Rounds (1-6):
- **Always prioritize RB** until you have 2-3 startable backs
- **Exception:** Elite WR (top-6) falling 1+ rounds

### Middle Rounds (7-10):
- **RB25-28:** Last chance for RB2 consistency
- **WR15-25:** Better long-term value than RB30+

### Late Rounds (11+):
- **Prioritize WR depth** over speculative RBs
- **Exception:** Clear handcuff to your RB1/RB2

## Summary Recommendations

1. **RB20 vs WR10:** WR10 (value gap too large)
2. **RB25 vs WR15:** RB25 (last reliable RB2 tier)
3. **RB30 vs WR20:** WR20 (consistency advantage)
4. **RB35 vs WR25:** WR25 (floor/upside advantage)
5. **RB40 vs WR30:** WR30 (immediate impact advantage)

**Key Takeaway:** The sweet spot for RBs ends around RB24-28. After that, WR depth provides better value until very late rounds where you're looking for pure upside lottery tickets.
