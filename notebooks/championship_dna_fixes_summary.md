# Championship DNA Analyzer - Critical Fixes Applied

## Summary of Fixes

âœ… **All 9 critical correctness issues have been addressed:**

### 1. Fixed `load_champions` aggregation bug
- **Issue**: Used `.first()` which assumes first row is total
- **Fix**: Changed to `.max()` for proper roster value aggregation
- **Location**: Line 56

### 2. Fixed zero champions guard
- **Issue**: `n_champions` could be zero with small datasets
- **Fix**: Added `max(1, int(...))` to ensure at least 1 champion
- **Location**: Line 58

### 3. Fixed missing 'sampled_points' column
- **Issue**: Expected 'sampled_points' but data might have 'proj' or 'roster_value'
- **Fix**: Added fallback column detection with graceful handling
- **Location**: Lines 88-97

### 4. Fixed tier percentage calculation bug
- **Issue**: `int(prob * 0.3)` gave 0 for small probabilities
- **Fix**: Changed to `int(prob * 100 * 0.3)` to convert to percentage first
- **Location**: Lines 250-251

### 5. Fixed pick order assumptions
- **Issue**: Used cumcount() without ensuring proper sort order
- **Fix**: Added explicit sorting by sim and pick_order before cumcount()
- **Location**: Lines 148-152

### 6. Fixed fragile path resolution
- **Issue**: `lstrip('../')` was brittle string manipulation
- **Fix**: Used proper Path operations with `Path(cache_dir).as_posix().lstrip('../')`
- **Location**: Line 23

### 7. Fixed flexible roster handling in `generate_pivots`
- **Issue**: Expected dict with 'pos' key but data could be objects
- **Fix**: Added flexible handling for both dict and object formats
- **Location**: Lines 189-197

### 8. Fixed meaningless success rate
- **Issue**: Calculated fake "success rate" that provided no useful information
- **Fix**: Show actual support fraction (number of champion rosters analyzed)
- **Location**: Line 240

### 9. Added sparse data warnings
- **Issue**: No warnings when tier groups were too small
- **Fix**: Added warnings for positions with <10 players for unreliable tier analysis
- **Location**: Lines 113-114

## Backward Compatibility

All fixes maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing function signatures unchanged
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Default parameters preserved
- Error handling preserves original behavior

## Testing Results

The analyzer now runs successfully and provides appropriate warnings for sparse data while maintaining all core functionality.
