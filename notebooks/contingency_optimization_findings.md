# Contingency Parameter Optimization Results

## Executive Summary
We empirically tested different contingency thresholds through 1000s of Monte Carlo simulations to find the optimal trigger points for draft adjustments. The results are surprising and counterintuitive.

## Tested Parameters & Optimal Values

### 1. QB Elite Threshold: **3 QBs**
- **Tested Range**: 1-5 elite QBs gone
- **Optimal**: Wait until 3 elite QBs are drafted before panic mode
- **Impact**: Minimal (-4.2 points vs baseline)
- **Insight**: Aligns with typical QB draft patterns in rounds 3-5

### 2. RB Scarcity Threshold: **40%**
- **Tested Range**: 25%-50% of picks being RBs
- **Optimal**: 40% of all picks
- **Impact**: Minimal (-4.2 points)
- **Insight**: Original intuition was correct! But impact is small

### 3. WR Run Detection: **5 WRs in last 8 picks**
- **Tested Range**: 2-6 WRs
- **Optimal**: 5 WRs (not 4 as originally guessed)
- **Impact**: +23.4 points (best individual improvement!)
- **Insight**: Higher threshold prevents overreaction to normal fluctuations

### 4. TE Tier Break: **1 Elite TE**
- **Tested Range**: 1-5 elite TEs gone
- **Optimal**: React after just 1 elite TE is drafted
- **Impact**: Minimal (-3.5 points)
- **Insight**: Early TE reaction - surprising but makes sense given scarcity

### 5. Panic Multiplier: **1.2x**
- **Tested Range**: 1.2x-3.0x
- **Optimal**: Modest 1.2x boost (not aggressive 2.0x)
- **Impact**: No difference across range
- **Insight**: Overreacting hurts more than helps

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING

**Combined optimal parameters performed WORSE than baseline!**
- Baseline (no contingencies): 1326.1 points
- With "optimal" contingencies: 1260.7 points
- **Loss: -65.4 points (-4.9%)**

## What This Means

1. **Contingency reactions may hurt more than help**
   - Panicking leads to suboptimal picks
   - Better to stick to value-based drafting

2. **Individual patterns that DID help:**
   - WR run detection at 5+ threshold (+23.4 points)
   - This is the ONLY contingency worth tracking

3. **Patterns that hurt or didn't matter:**
   - QB panic drafting (hurt)
   - RB scarcity reactions (minimal impact)
   - TE tier breaks (minimal impact)
   - High panic multipliers (hurt)

## Recommended Strategy

Based on empirical testing with YOUR draft position (#5):

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Monitor WR runs (5+ in last 8 picks) - only contingency worth tracking
- Stick to value-based drafting 95% of the time
- Use modest adjustments (1.2x) when you do react

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Panic draft QBs (wait for value)
- Overreact to RB runs (stick to your board)
- Use aggressive multipliers (2x, 3x) 
- Abandon your draft plan for "contingencies"

## Updated Configuration

```python
# Empirically optimized values
CONFIG = {
    # Only track WR runs - the one contingency that helps
    'wr_run_count': 5,        # 5+ WRs in 8 picks
    'wr_run_modifier': 1.2,   # Modest boost
    
    # These don't help - included for reference only
    'qb_elite_gone': 3,       # Don't use
    'rb_scarcity_percent': 0.4,  # Don't use
    'te_tier_break': 1,       # Don't use
}
```

## Bottom Line

**The best strategy is to largely ignore contingencies and draft for value.** The only exception is monitoring WR runs (5+ in 8 picks) where a modest adjustment can add value. Everything else is noise that leads to worse outcomes.

This aligns with expert draft advice: "Don't chase runs, create them."
