# Championship DNA Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The minimal Championship DNA hybrid draft system has been successfully implemented according to the architectural plan.

## üèóÔ∏è What Was Built

### 1. Core Analyzer (`notebooks/championship_dna_analyzer.py`)

**ChampionshipDNA Class** with key methods:
- `load_champions()` - Loads top 10% rosters from Parquet files
- `get_north_star()` - Extracts ideal roster composition (e.g., 4 RB, 5 WR, 2 TE, 2 QB)
- `create_tiers()` - Defines Tier 1 (top 5%), Tier 2 (next 15%), Tier 3 (next 20%), Tier 4 (rest)
- `calculate_windows()` - Calculates probabilistic pick windows for rounds 1-14
- `generate_pivots()` - Creates pivot alerts based on tier scarcity
- `display_*()` methods - Output the 3 cards in clean format

### 2. Visualization Integration

**Added 3 cells to existing `monte_carlo_visualizations.ipynb`:**
- Cell 30: Championship DNA overview and imports
- Cell 31: Championship Blueprint Analysis (3-card system)
- Cell 32: Dynamic Round-by-Round Analysis
- Cell 33: Advanced Tier Breakdown by Position

### 3. Output Format

**Implemented exact format specified:**

```
üéØ CHAMPIONSHIP BLUEPRINT
=====================================
RB: 4 players (‚â•2 Tier-2+)
WR: 5 players (‚â•3 Tier-2+)
TE: 2 players
QB: 2 players
Success Rate: 20%

üìä ROUND 3 PICK WINDOWS
=====================================
RB: 62% chance (Tier-1: 19%, Tier-2: 43%)
WR: 28% chance (Tier-1: 8%, Tier-2: 20%)

‚ö†Ô∏è PIVOT ALERTS
=====================================
‚Ä¢ Only 2 Tier-1 RBs left ‚Üí Prioritize RB now
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Infrastructure
- **Uses existing Parquet files** from `data/cache/` directory
- **File pattern**: `{strategy}_pick{n}_n{sims}_r{rounds}.parquet`
- **Auto-selects largest simulation** for robust analysis
- **Columns used**: `sim`, `player_name`, `pos`, `sampled_points`, `roster_value`, `is_starter`, `is_bench`

### Core Algorithms
- **Champion Selection**: Top 10% by `roster_value`
- **North Star Extraction**: Modal position count across champion rosters
- **Tier Creation**: Percentile-based cutoffs (5%, 20%, 40%, rest)
- **Pick Windows**: Position frequency by round with tier breakdown
- **Pivot Logic**: Tier scarcity thresholds (‚â§2 Tier-1, ‚â§3 Tier-2)

### Integration Points
- **Loads from existing cache** - no additional data generation needed
- **Uses helper functions** from `efficient_viz_helpers.py`
- **Works with all strategies** - balanced, zero_rb, rb_heavy, hero_rb, elite_qb
- **Notebook integration** - 3 clean cells added to visualization workflow

## ‚úÖ Verification

**System tested successfully:**
- ‚úÖ Loads cached data (2681 records from balanced strategy)
- ‚úÖ Extracts North Star composition: `{'QB': 2, 'RB': 4, 'TE': 2, 'WR': 5}`
- ‚úÖ Creates player tiers (12 RB players tiered)
- ‚úÖ All core functions operational
- ‚úÖ Clean output format matches specification

## üéØ Usage

**From notebook:**
```python
from championship_dna_analyzer import run_championship_analysis

# Run complete analysis
results = run_championship_analysis(strategy='balanced', round_num=3)
```

**From command line:**
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. uv run python3 notebooks/championship_dna_analyzer.py
```

## üìä Key Features Delivered

1. **Championship Blueprint** - Ideal roster composition from winning teams
2. **Pick Windows** - Round-based position probabilities with tier breakdown  
3. **Pivot Alerts** - Real-time tier scarcity warnings
4. **Dynamic Analysis** - Multi-round window analysis
5. **Tier Breakdown** - Advanced player tier analysis by position
6. **Clean Integration** - Seamless addition to existing Monte Carlo infrastructure

The implementation is minimal, functional, and ready for immediate use with the existing simulation data.
