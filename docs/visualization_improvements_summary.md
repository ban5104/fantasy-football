# Monte Carlo Visualization Improvements

## Summary
Implemented 3 high-impact, low-effort visualization improvements to enhance draft-day decision making.

## Improvements Completed

### 1. Position Value Curves with Uncertainty Bands ✅
**File**: `notebooks/efficient_viz_helpers.py` - `create_position_value_curves()`

**Changes**:
- Added 50% confidence band (25th-75th percentile) in darker shade
- Added 80% confidence band (10th-90th percentile) in lighter shade  
- Bands calculated from simulation data showing projection uncertainty
- Maintains backward compatibility - works with or without simulation data

**Impact**: Shows confidence in value projections at each position rank, helping identify high-certainty vs high-variance players.

### 2. Interactive Availability Heatmap with Round Slider ✅
**File**: `notebooks/efficient_viz_helpers.py` - `create_interactive_availability_heatmap()`

**Features**:
- ipywidgets slider for rounds 0-14
- Round 0 shows overall draft rates
- Rounds 1-14 show cumulative availability through that round
- Dynamic heatmap updates showing when players typically get drafted
- Graceful fallback to static heatmap if ipywidgets unavailable

**Impact**: Interactive exploration of player availability by round, helping identify optimal draft timing for target players.

### 3. Decision Cards for Next Pick Recommendations ✅
**File**: `notebooks/efficient_viz_helpers.py` - `create_decision_cards()`

**Features**:
- HTML cards showing top 3 player recommendations
- Visual confidence indicators (High/Medium/Low based on std deviation)
- 25th-75th percentile range displayed
- Starter rate percentage
- Position-specific color coding
- Text fallback for non-Jupyter environments

**Impact**: Clear, actionable recommendations with uncertainty ranges for immediate draft decisions.

## Usage

### In Notebook
```python
# Import new functions
from efficient_viz_helpers import (
    create_position_value_curves,
    create_interactive_availability_heatmap,
    create_decision_cards
)

# 1. Enhanced position curves
fig = create_position_value_curves(sims_df, full_universe, n_rounds=14)

# 2. Interactive heatmap
interactive_heatmap = create_interactive_availability_heatmap(all_strategies_df, top_n=25)

# 3. Decision cards
top_players = create_decision_cards(sims_df, current_pick=5, top_n=3)
```

### Files Modified
- `notebooks/efficient_viz_helpers.py` - Added 3 new/enhanced functions
- `notebooks/monte_carlo_visualizations.ipynb` - Added demonstration cells

## Design Principles
1. **Minimal changes** - Enhanced existing functions rather than rewriting
2. **Backward compatible** - All changes work with existing data structures
3. **Graceful degradation** - Features degrade gracefully when dependencies unavailable
4. **Performance focused** - Uses existing cached data, no new computations

## Next Steps (Future Improvements)
- Add linked brushing between charts for coordinated selection
- Implement "rush detection" overlay for position runs
- Add scenario comparison panel with sliders
- Create compact "urgent mode" layout for pick countdown

## Time Investment
Total implementation time: ~45 minutes
- Position curves with uncertainty: 15 minutes
- Interactive heatmap slider: 20 minutes  
- Decision cards: 10 minutes
