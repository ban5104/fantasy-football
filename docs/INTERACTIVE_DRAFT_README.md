Comprehensive draft evaluation and season planning:

#### Team Analysis
- **Draft Grade** - A+ to C- rating based on value and balance
- **VBD Analysis** - Total and positional value breakdown
- **Strength/Weakness** - Identify surplus and deficit positions
- **Value Analysis** - How much draft value gained/lost

#### League Comparison
- Rank all 14 teams by total value
- Compare draft efficiency across league
- Visual scatter plots of team performance

#### Season Strategy
- **Trade Recommendations** - Based on positional surplus/deficit
- **Waiver Wire Targets** - Prioritized by team needs

## 🎪 Advanced Features

### State Management
The system maintains complete draft state including:
- Available player pool (updates in real-time)
- All team rosters with pick numbers and rounds
- Complete draft history with timestamps
- Snake draft order calculations

### Value-Based Drafting (VBD)
Uses your league's specific scoring system to calculate player values:
- Custom VBD scores based on replacement-level baselines
- Position-specific value calculations
- Accounts for league size and roster requirements

### Smart Recommendations
- **Positional Needs** - Tracks each team's roster requirements
- **Tier Breaks** - Warns when elite tiers are depleting
- **Scarcity Alerts** - Prioritizes positions with limited depth
- **Value Opportunities** - Highlights players falling below ADP

### Draft Analytics
Real-time insights during your draft:
- Recent pick analysis
- Position run detection
- Remaining player counts by position
- Team-by-team need assessment

## 🔧 Configuration

### League Setup (`config/league-config.yaml`)
```yaml
basic_settings:
  teams: 14
  scoring_type: "Head to Head Points"

roster:
  total_size: 16
  roster_slots:
    QB: 1
    RB: 2
    WR: 2
    TE: 1
    FLEX: 1
    DEF: 1
    K: 1

scoring:
  passing:
    yards: 0.04
    touchdown: 4
  # ... detailed scoring system
```

### Data Sources
- **Player Projections** - Position-specific CSV files
- **Rankings/Cheat Sheet** - Value-based draft rankings
- **League Configuration** - Scoring and roster settings

## 🎲 Mock Drafting

Test different strategies with the built-in simulator:

```python
# Run mock draft from position 7 with best available strategy
simulator = MockDraftSimulator(config, cheat_sheet, draft_position=7)
my_team, draft_log = simulator.run_mock_draft('BEST_AVAILABLE')
```

**Strategies Available:**
- `BEST_AVAILABLE` - Pure value drafting
- `POSITIONAL_NEED` - Balances value with roster needs

## 📈 Example Workflow

### Pre-Draft (1-2 days before)
1. **Run Draft Preparation**
   - Analyze positional scarcity
   - Identify sleepers and busts
   - Run 3-5 mock drafts from your position
   - Study tier breaks for target rounds

### Draft Day
2. **Use Interactive Draft Board**
   - Load your preparation data
   - Set up league configuration
   - Track all picks in real-time
   - Get recommendations for your picks
   - Save draft state periodically

### Post-Draft (same day)
3. **Analyze Results**
   - Load completed draft
   - Get your team grade and analysis
   - Compare against league
   - Get trade recommendations
   - Plan waiver wire strategy

## 🏆 Performance Benefits

- **Middle Rounds (4-8)** - Target positional needs and value
- **Late Rounds (9+)** - Handcuffs, upside plays, and depth

### Using the Tools
- **Save Often** - Use save/load to preserve progress
- **Multiple Views** - Switch tabs to see different perspectives  
- **Quick Draft** - Use testing buttons to simulate scenarios
- **Position Filters** - Focus on specific positions when needed

### Team Analysis
- **VBD Focus** - Higher total VBD generally means better team
- **Balance Matters** - Avoid too many players at same position
- **Value Tracking** - Positive value gained = drafting efficiency
- **Weakness Planning** - Address deficits through trades/waivers
