# Fantasy Draft Board Enhancement Implementation Summary

## Fixes Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes (Completed)

#### Scarcity Calculation Bug
- **Issue**: Method `get_available_player_ids()` was confusingly named and caused scarcity alerts to show "Only 0 elite players left!"
- **Fix**: Renamed to `get_drafted_player_ids()` and updated all references across `draft_engine.py`
- **Files Modified**: `/Users/ben/projects/fantasy-football-draft-spreadsheet-visuals/draft_engine.py`
- **Lines**: 198, 283, 333, 361, 409, 429

#### Player Dropdown Bug  
- **Issue**: Empty player dropdown due to incorrect method call
- **Fix**: Updated `update_player_list()` method in notebook to use corrected method name
- **Files Modified**: `/Users/ben/projects/fantasy-football-draft-spreadsheet-visuals/minimal_draft_board.ipynb`

  - Position prominently displayed
  - VBD score shown

### 3. Position Heat Map (Completed)
