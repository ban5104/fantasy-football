# Statistical Core Concepts for Data Scientists & Engineers

*Quick technical reference for understanding the statistical foundations of this fantasy football draft analysis system.*

## ðŸŽ¯ System Overview (2-minute read)

This is a **probabilistic optimization system** for fantasy draft strategy that evolves traditional Value-Based Drafting (VBD) with modern statistical methods:

- **Traditional VBD**: Static replacement levels based on league roster math
- **Enhanced VBD**: Dynamic, probabilistic replacement levels with roster-aware utility scoring
- **Core Innovation**: Real-time integration of selection probabilities with Bayesian roster construction

## ðŸ“Š Key Statistical Methods

### 1. Value-Based Drafting (VBD) Foundation

**Core Concept**: Player value = Expected points above replacement level

```python
VBD_player = E[fantasy_points] - replacement_level[position]
```

**Replacement Level Methods:**
- **VOLS**: `baseline = teams Ã— starters` (conservative)
- **VORP**: `baseline = teams Ã— (starters + 1)` (includes bench depth)  
- **BEER**: `baseline = teams Ã— (starters + 0.5)` (optimal balance)

**Mathematical Justification**: Replacement level represents the **marginal utility breakpoint** where drafting additional players at a position provides diminishing returns.

### 2. Dynamic Baseline Adjustment (Current Implementation)

**Problem**: Static replacement levels ignore draft flow and position runs.

**Solution**: Real-time baseline adjustment using **sigmoid transformation**:

```python
expected_picks = position_probability Ã— horizon_picks
adjustment = scale Ã— tanh(expected_picks / kappa)
adjusted_baseline = interpolate_baseline(baseline_rank + adjustment)
```

**Statistical Properties:**
- **Bounded output**: tanh limits adjustment magnitude 
- **Smooth transitions**: Continuous derivative prevents value discontinuities
- **Empirically tuned**: `scale=3.0, kappa=5.0` based on draft simulation data

### 3. Probabilistic Enhancement (Next Generation)

**Core Innovation**: Replace static replacement with **dynamic probability-based calculation**.

#### Dynamic Replacement Level
```python
def calculate_dynamic_replacement(position, selection_probs, horizon=20):
    """
    Probabilistic replacement = best player likely to survive next 20 picks
    
    Statistical basis: If P(selected) < 0.3, player has 70% survival probability
    """
    available = get_available_at_position(position) 
    likely_survivors = [p for p in available if selection_probs[p.name] < 0.3]
    return likely_survivors[0].fantasy_points if likely_survivors else fallback
```

**Advantages over static**:
- **Adaptive**: Responds to actual draft behavior patterns
- **Realistic**: Accounts for positional runs and draft panics  
- **Data-driven**: Uses empirical selection probabilities vs. theoretical math

#### Positional Need Index (PNI)

**Problem**: VBD ignores roster construction context.

**Solution**: Bayesian calculation of expected roster shortfall:

```python
def calculate_PNI(position, my_roster, selection_probs):
    """
    PNI = Expected utility loss from not addressing positional need
    
    Combines:
    - Current roster gaps (deterministic)
    - Expected future supply (probabilistic)  
    - Opportunity cost of shortfall (VBD-based)
    """
    slots_needed = get_remaining_positional_requirements(position, my_roster)
    
    # Expected players available later = sum of survival probabilities
    expected_supply = sum([1 - prob for prob in selection_probs if prob < 0.5])
    
    # Shortfall = expected deficit in roster construction
    shortfall = max(0, slots_needed - expected_supply)
    
    # Cost = VBD penalty for replacement-level vs. starter-quality
    opportunity_cost = calculate_tier_gap_penalty(position)
    
    return shortfall * opportunity_cost
```

**Statistical Foundation**: 
- **Expected value calculation** for future player availability
- **Loss function** based on VBD scoring differentials
- **Bayesian updating** as draft progresses and probabilities change

#### Unified Utility Function

**Final Integration**: Combine all factors into single optimization target:

```python
Utility_i = P_available Ã— (VBD_i - R_dynamic) Ã— (1 + Î² Ã— PNI_position)
```

**Components**:
- **P_available**: Selection probability (0-1 scale)
- **VBD_i - R_dynamic**: Marginal value above realistic replacement  
- **PNI_position**: Roster construction urgency multiplier
- **Î²**: Tuning parameter balancing market vs. personal factors

**Mathematical Properties**:
- **Bounded**: All terms have natural limits preventing extreme values
- **Monotonic**: Higher value players with higher need yield higher utility
- **Separable**: Components can be analyzed and optimized independently
- **Interpretable**: Direct mapping to draft decision factors
